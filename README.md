This repo contains scripts used in the Virbos ISO (currently only virbos-setup).

# For developers and other VirbOS Developers
The virbos-profile script uses the same script infrustracture as virbos-setup which means you can contribute with the same style of virbos-setup script.
The ask functions and the functions they depend on was ported to virbos-profile (thanks to the function design which makes code reuse a lot easier)
